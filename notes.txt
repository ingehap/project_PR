
Thus, the Poisson’s ratio of felsic rocks (Figure 8) is essentially controlled
by relative volume fractions of quartz and feldspar and the anorthite
content in plagioclase.

The increase in PR with ρ, ranging from acid and intermediate to mafic rocks, 
is controlled by variations in quartz and feldspar contents in the rocks 
(Brocher, 2005; Christensen, 1996; Ji & Salisbury, 1993; Tarkov & Vavakin, 1982).
